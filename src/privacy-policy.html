                                tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your PII up to a period of 12
                                months in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of
                                litigation in respect to our relationship with you. This period could be longer if legal
                                issues arise.

                                lawfully processing it.

                                verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

                                the right to ask us to delete or remove your PII where you have successfully exercised
                                your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your
